Description: Interactive visualization for Bayesian prior and posterior distributions. 
             When both distributions are providers the animation shows a transition from 
             prior to posterior. Finally, the animation splits the distribution using the provided 
             `breaks` into bars that show the probability for each region. 
             If no `breaks` are providers it will use zero by default.
